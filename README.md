# Countries-API
Countries API is a Python-based command-line tool that interacts with the Rest Countries API. It allows users to get the total number of countries, list country names, and retrieve details like population and currencies. This project is part of a bonus module from the Pentest: From Zero to Professional course by Solyd.
